Christopher is one of the project; `Christopher` for familiarising with machine learning and other basic Artificial Intelligence concepts.

This repository highly depends on the tutorial provided by Tensorflow.

It is capable of the followings;
* Classify image between `cat` and `dog`
* Training the model continuously by loading previous model weights.
* Evaluate and predict any type of image that user wants to predict.

This repository is purely for educational purpose.
