# Christopher_Cat
### Introduction
Christopher is one of the project; `Christopher` for familiarising with machine learning and other basic Artificial Intelligence concepts.

This repository highly depends on the tutorial provided by Tensorflow.

It is capable of the followings;
* Classify image between `cat` and `dog`
* Training the model continuously by loading previous model weights.
* Evaluate and predict any type of image that user wants to predict.

This repository is purely for educational purpose.

### Future Implementation
Data statistics visualization using `Tensorboard`

### Libraries Used
1. Tensorflow: 2.0
1. Pillow: 6.2.1
1. Scipy: 1.4.0
1. Numpy: 1.17.4
